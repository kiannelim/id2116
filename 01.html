    <p class="pcontent">
      Today, we were introduced to HTML and CSS. This was the day that this website was born.
      <br>
      <br>
      We also learned tried connecting electrical components to the microbit via a breadboard.
      We thought we could escape Physics but no!
    </p>

    <p class="pcontent">
      <img style="text-align: center;" src="IMAGE/gif_variableresistor.gif"; height="50%"> <br>
      We used components like;
      <ul>
        <li>LED</li>
        <li>Resistors</li>
        <li>Variable resistors</li>
        <li>Connecting wires</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="pcontent">
      <i>Problems faced</i> <br>
      It was a little tricky trying to make the variable resistor work because the varying resistor in the diagram looked 
      different from the actual component. But with some technical knowledge and a few attempts, we were able to make it work! 
      The feeling of accomplishment made the confusion worthwhile.
    </p>

    <p class="pcontent">
      <i>Lessons learnt</i> <br>
      I think the greatest takeaway from this lesson was the basic knowledge of building a website from scratch. I was suddenly 
      exposed to a world of possibilties - where (almost) anything can be created with logical thinking. <br>
      Through this exercise, I went on to further explore various functions within a website. Some include;
      <ul>
        <li>Adding hyperlinks (for pages within and outside this webpage);</li>
        <li>Creating hyperlinks that open in a new tab (instead of redirecting);</li>
        <li>Creating links that allow readers to scroll straight to a specific line on the page;</li>
        <li>Creating margins (this improved the look of the webpage significantly);</li>
        <li>Adding a horizontal line (for segmantation);</li>
        <li>Breaking a line (like "enter", except that html ignores and "enters" made here and the words just clump up);</li>
        <li>Adding emojis and gifs. &#128515</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="pcontent">
      Although I still wondered why I would go through all this trouble when I could already build (an even better) and
      update (an even more convenient) platform using Wix or Weebly.
    </p>

    <p class="pcontent">
      <i>Possible applications</i> <br>
      With the ability to connect and control external components to the mircrobit, we could perhaps attach other critical sensors 
      and perhaps a battery casing to power the microbit remotely. <br>
    </p>

  <div style="padding-top: 60px; padding-bottom: 60px; padding-left: 250px; padding-right: 250px;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Microbit Project Progress</h2>
    <img style="text-align: center;" src="IMAGE/week1_brainstorm.jpeg"; width=100%;> <br>
    <p class="pcontent">
      The brainstorming session for the chosen object began. Here were some of the options that we considered. We began by
      looking at potential movements - those that were gradual and measurable.
    </p>

    <p class="pcontent">
      From there, we shortlisted three - Tap, Swivel Chair and a Box. We then proceeded to analyse each of their form and function,
      and assess their potential for this project.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">Tap</h2>
    <!-- INSERT <img> HERE -->
    <p class="pcontent"> Specifically, the flow of water.</p>
    <p class="pcontent">
      We thought it would be interesting to pick an everyday object and measure a fluid element. The intention was to vary sound
      or visuals with the intensity of the water flow. The strategy was to place impact or pressure sensors on the pivoting
      point of the tap, or the bottom of the sink bed. With the ability to vary sound using the flow of water, perhaps
      it would then be possible to play a tune with multiple taps? WATER BAND MOMENT.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">Swivel Chair</h2>
    <img src="IMAGE/swivelchair.jpg" style="width: 50%;">
    <p class="pcontent"> Specifically, the green studio chair.</p>
    <p class="pcontent">
      Like the tap, we wanted to use everyday-forgotten items to nudge people to gain a greater appreciation for the things around them.
      We intended to program the accelerometer to respond to the speed at which its occupant was rolling about.
      This was to bring an element of fun and play into the everyday object.
      Unlike the tap however, the chair had a greater potential of serving a purpose. We also intended to program light sensors
      on the backrest to indicate whether a chair was occupied or not. This could signify the availability of seats in the studio, hence
      serving a pragmatic function beyond play.
